Hi, I am codenirey. I am underage, but not for long anymore. Now, at the time of writing this I am kind of new to programming, 
so I don't know how these README files are usually written, but I will try my best. I am currently learning python,
and I just finished my simple hangman project. I will post every project I make here
for you to look at, and for me to save it somewhere safe. After getting comfortable with python, I plan to
start making a website and experiment with the languages associated to it. Thank you for reading!
